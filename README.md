I have created this FEM calculator in the scope of my bachleor thesis at the University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering. The following is a mere POC or proof of concept of my work titled "Open-source tools for online finite element analysis".

To run the project download it locally either through CLI or Github "Download" button
1. Then run `yarn` or `npm install` to download dependencies. 
2. Then run `yarn start` or npm equivalent.
3. You are all set. The browser should open `localhost:8000`.

You can see `live demo` on this link: https://fem-calc.netlify.app/

It is important to note that calculations here are not optimizied and thus not appropriate for production.
